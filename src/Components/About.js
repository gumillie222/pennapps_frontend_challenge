                <h2>The College Hackaton</h2>
                <body class="normaltext">
                    In the context of a hackathon, the word "hack" is used to describe how multiple technologies can be used 
                    together in a new and innovative way. Teams of up to four people spend the weekend working on 
                    innovative software and hardware solutions to real-world problems. These projects range in platform and 
                    application, including elements of web development, mobile applications, drones, and more. However, 
                    many times the most important aspect of a hackathon is the community it generates and skills that 
                    inexperienced hackers walk away with.

                <h2>The PennApps Difference</h2>
                <body class="normaltext">
                    Founded in the fall of 2009, PennApps was the nation's first student-run college hackathon. Since then, 
                    it has spurred a revolution in the way engineering students develop and showcase their skills, spawning an 
                    entire "league" of hackathons across the nation. In past years, over a thousand students from the U.S. and 
                    other countries like Switzerland, Canada, England, and Singapore have converged in Philadelphia for the 
                    spring and fall editions of the event for a weekend of creation and discovery. Both beginners and experts 
                    alike will work together, learn and compete to become better engineers and work on awesome projects. 
                    This year, PennApps is expanding its focus on learning by emphasizing the collaboration of new and 
                    experienced hackers, and providing more learning opportunities and workshops throughout the weekend.
